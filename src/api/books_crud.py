"""
A Flask API for managing a library of books.

This script defines a Flask Blueprint for managing a library of books, with
endpoints for rendering the books page, getting a book by ID, creating a new
book, and deleting a book by ID.The API reads and writes data to a global
storage module, which manages the library of books.

Endpoints:
    - GET /books: Render the books page.
    - GET /books/<int:book_id>: Get a book by ID.
    - POST /books: Create a new book.
    - DELETE /books/<int:book_id>: Delete a book by ID.

Global Storage:
    The API reads and writes data to the `src.storage.global_storage` module,
    which defines functions for reading, adding, updating, and deleting books
    in the library.

Example Usage:
    app.register_blueprint(books_api)

    The Flask application should register the books_api Blueprint to use the
    API.

Dependencies:
    This script depends on the Flask and dataclasses modules, as well as the
    `src.storage.global_storage` module for managing the library of books.
